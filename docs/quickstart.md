Quick start
===========

A [web3j-corda sample project](https://gitlab.com/web3j/corda-samples) is available that demonstrates a number of core features of Cordapp using web3j-corda, including:

* Interact with a CorDapp listing its nodes and starting a flow.
* Generate automated tests using Docker containers to verify the working of CorDapp.
